Hey!

This folder contains two distict tasks completed using Hadoop MapReduce. Here is a brief description of both:

### Total Revenue

In this file, I calculate the revenue generated per date. This is a simple tasks that only requires a single map and reduce job. 

### TaxiDrivers:

In this file, I determine the top five taxi drivers, in terms of revenue generated. This task requires two map and reduce jobs. The first pairs each driver with the revenue they generated, while the second job analyses all those pairs and finds the drivers with the highest total revenue.
